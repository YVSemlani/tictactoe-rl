# Product Requirements Document

1. Purpose and Scope

Purpose: Define requirements for a C++-based reinforcement learning (RL) environment supporting NxN Tic-Tac-Toe, LLM integration, custom reward optimization (PPO/GRPO), and GPU-accelerated kernels.

Scope:
	•	Core game engine in modern C++.
	•	Plugin architecture for RL algorithms and reward functions.
	•	API for interaction with open-source LLMs.
	•	Support for custom CUDA kernels for performance.

2. Goals and Objectives
	•	Educational Demonstration: Showcase technical mastery of C++, RL, and GPU optimization.
	•	Modularity: Enable swapping RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO) and reward definitions without core changes.
	•	Performance: Real-time training and inference with large N board sizes via GPU kernels.
	•	Extensibility: Simple integration of new LLMs and custom kernels.

3. Stakeholders
	•	Primary Developer: You (C++ and GPU expert).
	•	Reviewer: ML Research team.
	•	End-User: Researchers and students experimenting with RL.

4. Functional Requirements
	1.	Game Mechanics
	•	Parameterizable board size N (e.g., 3, 5, 10).
	•	Valid move detection, win/draw determination.
	2.	Environment API
	•	reset(), step(action), get_state(), is_done() methods.
	•	Gym-style C++ interface.
	3.	State Representation
	•	Tensor-like board representation (channels for each player).
	•	Optionally one-hot or flattened vector outputs.
	4.	Action Space
	•	Discrete actions indexed 0…N×N−1.
	5.	Reward Structure
	•	Default: +1 win, −1 loss, 0 draw.
	•	Hooks for custom reward callbacks.
	6.	Custom Reward Functions
	•	Interface allowing user-provided C++ functor or Python callback (via pybind11).
	7.	RL Algorithm Integration
	•	Example implementations of PPO and GRPO modules using existing C++ RL libraries (e.g., RL-cpp).
	•	Configuration files for hyperparameters.
	8.	LLM Interaction Module
	•	API connector to open-source LLMs (e.g., using HTTP/REST or gRPC).
	•	Functions: query_llm(prompt, state, options) to request move suggestions or commentary.
	9.	GPU Kernel Support
	•	Abstraction layer for custom CUDA kernels for batch state evaluation and reward computation.
	•	Example kernel for batched loss calculation.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance: Able to process ≥1,000 episodes/sec at N=10 with GPU kernels.
	•	Scalability: Minimal overhead when enabling/disabling modules.
	•	Portability: Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows).
	•	Maintainability: Comprehensive unit tests and CI integration.

6. System Architecture
	•	Core Engine Module: Game logic and API.
	•	RL Interface Layer: Algorithm plugins and training loop.
	•	LLM Connector: Network interface to LLM service.
	•	GPU Acceleration Module: CUDA kernel management and scheduling.
	•	Utilities: Logging, configuration management, serialization.

7. Technical Stack
	•	Language: C++17 (or newer).
	•	Build: CMake.
	•	GPU: CUDA 11+.
	•	LLM API: REST client (libcurl) or gRPC (grpc-cpp).
	•	Bindings: pybind11 for Python callbacks.
	•	Testing: Google Test.

8. Data Flow
	1.	Initialization: Load config, initialize modules.
	2.	Episode Loop: Reset → step() calls → reward & state → until done.
	3.	Training Loop: Collect trajectories → update via PPO/GRPO → repeat.

9. Timeline & Milestones
	•	Week 1: Core engine + API.
	•	Week 2: RL interface + sample PPO.
	•	Week 3: LLM integration + examples.
	•	Week 4: GPU kernels + performance tuning.
	•	Week 5: Testing, documentation, demos.

10. Acceptance Criteria
	•	Successful game simulations at N=3,5,10.
	•	Training runs with PPO/GRPO achieving >70% win rate on 3×3.
	•	LLM queries return valid suggestions.
	•	GPU kernels speedup ≥5× over CPU baseline.

11. Risks & Mitigations
	•	Complexity of CUDA: Provide sample kernels and documentation.
	•	LLM API changes: Abstract connector layer.
	•	RL library compatibility: Use header-only or well-maintained libraries.
