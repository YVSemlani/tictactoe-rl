# Tic Tac Toe RL Environment 

Implemented as part of an AI tools training during my summer 2025 ML engineering internship at Careset.

## Goals

I wanted to explore a few skills with this project:
- C++ implementation of a quick game environment
- Using OSS LLMs to interact with real world environments
- Implementing verifiers/reward functions to post-train model
- Working with RL algorithms like GRPO, PPO, etc.
- Writing custom kernels to speed up various parts of the training process

Beyond these individual skills, tying them all together helped to understand integration challenges with creating real world ML for games pipelines.
